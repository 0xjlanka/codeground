1. test/uid.c - If you are the root user, this will provide access to roots shell(bash)

a. Since uid.o contains dynamically linked libs, use myLib.so in lib/ and execute as:
$ LD_PRELOAD=<Full absolute path to>/lib/myLib.so ./uid.o
b. If uid.o is statically linked, (1) doesn't work. use id_injector from ptrace/ and execute as:
$ ./id_injector ../test/uid.o

2. test/simple.c - Simple code injection test. change the value of the variable by code injection

Use code_inject from ptrace/
First, locate the address where the variable is set in the assembly dump by running:
$ objdump -S simple.o
locate the assignment line in the function <main>. The line should look like:
40055a: c7 45 fc a5 a5 a5 a5    movl   $0xa5a5a5a5,-0x4(%rbp)
Edit code_inject.c to trap this address and run as:
$ ./code_injector ../test/simple.o
